Simple Discord Bot for counting days since "The Accident"
</p>

It's sole purpose is to update once a day a specific message in a Discord server, adding one to the day counter.
It supports two commands:

1. !reiniciar
2. !sumar

Which resets and adds one to the counter manually. It also has basic case and error handling.
